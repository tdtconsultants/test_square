begin_time = 'begin_time2'

# Charge

Charges a card represented by a card nonce or a customer's card on file.

Your request to this endpoint must include _either_:

- A value for the `card_nonce` parameter (to charge a card nonce generated
  with the `SqPaymentForm`)
- Values for the `customer_card_id` and `customer_id` parameters (to charge
  a customer's card on file)

In order for an eCommerce payment to potentially qualify for
[Square chargeback protection](https://squareup.com/help/article/5394), you
_must_ provide values for the following parameters in your request:

- `buyer_email_address`
- At least one of `billing_address` or `shipping_address`

When this response is returned, the amount of Square's processing fee might not yet be
calculated. To obtain the processing fee, wait about ten seconds and call
[RetrieveTransaction](#endpoint-retrievetransaction). See the `processing_fee_money`
field of each [Tender included](#type-tender) in the transaction.

```python
def charge(self,
          location_id,
          body)
```
