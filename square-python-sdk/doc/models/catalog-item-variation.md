| `ordinal` | `int` | Optional | The order in which this item variation should be displayed. This value is read-only. On writes, the ordinal<br>for each item variation within a parent `CatalogItem` is set according to the item variations's<br>position.

For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer.
